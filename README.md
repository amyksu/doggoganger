# doggoganger
Created a Flask app that will predict what dog breed a human or dog most resembles using a Convolutional Neural Network and OpenCV. User then has the option to be redirected to PetFinder.com to see whether that dog is available for adoption. When fed a dog's photo, achieved 86% accuracy of predicting the correct breed.
